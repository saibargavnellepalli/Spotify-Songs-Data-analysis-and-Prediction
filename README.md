Spotify Songs Data analysis and Prediction

Introduction:
 
If music be the food of love, play onâ€¦
Over the centuries since Shakespeare,music has continued to be an indispensable aspect of our daily life.Not a day passes by without you humming a tune or listening to one.Our sources of listening to them have also evolved over time. From the vintage gramaphones through mix tapes through radio, our listening medium has now reached online music-streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple music, Google play etc are some of the most popular of these.
With over 36% market share among online music subscribers and having a base of over 100 million subscribers, Spotify occupies the top spot. As a music afficionado, this prompted me to dig deeper in to the spotify songs database to discover interesting trends regarding the songs, their artists and hopefully help people discover new music.
 
2.Data:
The Spotify_Data used for this analysis is a contiguous dataset of over 2.3 lakh songs with 18 audio features for each track, including confidence measures like 
Acousticness,
liveness, 
speechiness 
and time_signature,
 Instrumentalness,
 track_name 
 
 
 
3.The approach:
A three pronged approach is taken here :
An overview of the genres and the artists
An analysis of the track popularity and how it extends across genres
Based on the preferences of the user, build a simple system that gives out related songs based on genre and / or artist
Several univariate and multivariate analyses are done across variables post data preparation to substantiate the findings / results obtained by the above approaches
 
4.What I am going to do with the analysis:
Identify the association between different types of songs
As a music aficionado, find the songs that were off your radar
If you love that genre, get a recommendation for it
Identify the popular songs, the popularity of artists etc
